<h1>Welcome to Julia's Christmas Holiday!</h1>
	<h2><p>About My Holiday</p></h2>
<p>My holiday is Christmas! This holiday is celebrated on  December 25th, but most people celebrate Christmas the whole month of December.  The meaning of christmas is to celebrate the birth of Jesus. The gift giving on  Christmas comes from three men that brought Jesus gold, frankincense, and myrrh  as gifts.</p>

<p>My  special holiday means a lot to me, It brings my family together each year to my  grandmas house on christmas eve. My fondest memories of Christmas was coming  down to the tree and waiting for my parents to finish their cup of coffee to  open presents. We also do something active on Christmas after we opened our  gifts and eat a delicious breakfast.</p>
